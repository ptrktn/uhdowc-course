In this part, containerized Jupyter Notebook service is created. Image
`jupyter/scipy-notebook' is utilized since it contains the main common
Python data science libraries. Login process is streamlined by
providing a custom `jupyter_notebook_config.py' file with predefined
password `sauna'. Local directory `./work' is mounted into container
to provide easy access to files on the container host machine.
